# Sample Code #
This is a record of some of my code written for programming assignments and competitions. 
Most code will be written in Java and is uploaded as a `.java` file. Files are fully commented to allow for ease of reading.  

* [Palindrome Search](https://github.com/AditMisra/Sample-Code/blob/master/PalindromeSearch.java) 
  * This file runs a palindrome tester that intakes a character String between 6 and 30 characters long and outputs the largest palindrome(s) in the sequence (Minimum length 4). It is not case-sensitive and was written to follow a defined UML.
* [Arrays Calculator](https://github.com/AditMisra/Sample-Code/blob/master/ArraysAditi.java) 
  * This file runs a 2D Array Calculator off of the arrays inputted by the user through a file on a USB. This file is a `.txt` file of the following format:

 For every array pair, the sum, difference and product of the arrays is calculated and displayed, if possible. If these calculations are not possible, that result will also be displayed. 
 When running, the program will ask the user to input both, the drive letter of their USB key and the name of the file from which the calculations are carried out.
