# Sample Code #
This is a record of some of my code written for programming assignments and competitions. 
Most code will be written in Java and is uploaded as a `.java` file. Files are fully commented to allow for ease of reading.  

* [PalindromeSearch](https://github.com/AditMisra/Sample-Code/blob/master/PalindromeSearch.java) 
  * This file runs a palindrome tester that intakes a character String between 6 and 30 characters long and outputs the largest palindrome(s) in the sequence (Minimum length 4). It is not case-sensitive and was written to follow a defined UML.
